# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The goal of this project is to analyze all the rideshare data from January to April of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize. The visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer would help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Results
### Fig 1. Total Fare by City Type

The figure 1 chart illustrates that urban areas generated the highest total revenue, followed by suburban and rural areas. The revenue generated by all areras is fairly stady ovr the time period from January to April.

The observed outcome is expected as the urban areas have a high population density compared to suburban and rural areas. 

### Fig 2. Summary Dataframe by City Type

The figures in the summary Data Frame above implies certain underlying facts. To begin with, Urban areas has the highest total ride compared to suburban and rural areas with the ratio of 0.05:0.26:0.68 (Rural:Suburban:Urban). Urban areas also has the highest number of total drivers that is about 31 times higher than rural areas and about 4.9 times higher than suburban areas. Therefore, it has generated the highest total fares of $39,854.38.

However, urban areas has the lowest average fare per ride that is clearly shown in the ratio of 0.38:0.34:0.27 (Rural:Suburban:Urban) while the rural areas ranked the top. Furthermore, urban areas has the lowest average fare per driver. Rural areas is about 3.3 times higher and suburban areas is about 2.4 times higher than than the suburban areas.  

## Conclusions
1. Urban areas generate the most revenue for PyBer
2. Riders in Urban cities pay less per ride and therefore drivers earn leass per ride. 

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1. Increase the number of drivers in rural areas. The result of average fare per ride and per divr driver implies that the customers in the rural areas travel longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers occupied whenthere is a peak in service that could lead to a loss in revenue. 
2. Increase the number of drivers in suburban areas for the same reason as above stated. suburban and rural areas are underserved compared to urban areas. 
3. The specific number of drivers hiring requires the market research of users of Pyber.
